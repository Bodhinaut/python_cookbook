**Discussion**

Unpacking works with any object that happens to be iterable. Not just tuples or lists. This includes strings, files, iterators, and generators. When unpacking, you may sometimes want to discard certain values. Python has no special syntax for this, but you can just pick a throw away variable name. However, make sure the variable name you use is **NOT** in use already.
